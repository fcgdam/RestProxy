# REST Proxy server

This is a skeleton for a REST proxy server that proxies the
REST requests made to other REST servers.

This can be used for:
  - Centralizing requests to different REST servers into one server
  - Allowing access from a browser to a REST server that doesn't provide Same-origin headers
  - Allowing access to REST servers that need to go through a HTTP Proxy server.

Please note, this is just a Skeleton. It works but need work for more complex scenarios.
